# MIDTERM EXAM
## makeTrees.sh is a bash file that converts a fasta file into both an amino acid alignment and a codon alignment. After aligning both types, it makes phylogenetic tree of the both alignments. Each mini-script and file used in the program is listed below... 

# Scipts:

## translate.py
### Is a pre-written script that translates a raw DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.

## reverseTranslateAlignment.py
### Is a pre-written script that transcribes amino acid sequences into codons.

## drawTree.py
### Is a pre-written script that outputs phylogentic tress as PNG files.

# Files:

## adra2abcd.fasta
### -This file contains combined raw DNA sequences of the ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C and DRD2 genes of specific species. 

## adra2abcd.aa.fas
### -This file contains the amino acid sequence for ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C and DRD2.

## adra2abcd.mafft.aa.aln.fas
### -This file contains the *aligned* amino acid sequence for ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C and DRD2.

## adra2abcd.codon.aln.fas
### -This file contains the *aligned* codon sequence for ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C and DRD2.

## adra2abcd.codon.tree
### -This is a phylogenetic tree for the codon sequence.

## adra2abcd.aa.tree
### -This is a phylogenetic tree for the amino acid sequence. 

## adra2abcd.codon.tree.png
### This is a PNG/Image of a phylogenetic tree for the codon sequence. 

## adra2abcd.aa.tree.png
### This is a PNG/image of a phylogenetic treee for the amino acid sequence.
